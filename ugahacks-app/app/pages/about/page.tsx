        <p className="text-lg text-white">Genesis is a pioneering crowdfunding platform designed to empower creators and provide transparency for contributors. Built as a Kickstarter-like application, Genesis enables users to launch projects and receive funding in cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, our platform ensures financial accountability by locking a majority of the funds until the full funding goal is met. Developers receive a small portion upfront, while the rest remains secured. Contributors also have the power to safeguard their investmentsâ€”if a project fails to meet expectations, patrons can vote for cancellation, triggering a refund of the remaining funds. With Genesis, innovation and trust go hand in hand.</p>
