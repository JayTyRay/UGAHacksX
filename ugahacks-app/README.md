# UGAHacksX Project

This project is a web application developed for UGAHacksX.

This project, Genesis is developed at a kickstarter like application with the purpose of allowing users to pioneer their own project. These projects will allow for patrons to contribute crypto currency to help the developer fund the cost of their projects. This project offers the patrons the unique ability to control how their money is used since the contribution pool of a project is not entirely released to the developer untill the full contribution goal is reached. Before this time a small percentage will be available to the developer while the rest is locked up. To offer contributers a little security throughout the course of the project patrons can vote to cancel a project if it is not meeting their expectations. If a majority of the contributors vote to cancel a project the remaining amount in the contribution pool is refuneded to the crypto wallet of the patrons.
